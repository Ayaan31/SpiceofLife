Web Application Name: Spice of Life
Areas of Focus:
* Area 1:  HTML, CSS, and graphics for page layout and design

* Area 3:  Pull static data from a data file, e.g. JSON or XML (or both)
* Area 4:  Pull real data from a database


Proposal & Scope
* Purpose: 
   * Create a web application that holds a variety of cooking recipes in the following categories: Appetizers, Main, Desserts, Drinks
* What Does the Application Do?:
   * We can filter by: 
      * Vegetarian/Vegan
      * Search by Keyword
      * Allergy Friendly
      * Certain Nutrients
      * Calorie Count
      * Highest Amount of Reviews/Ratings  
   * We can also have: 
      * “Recipe of the Day” – something that changes/moves at the top daily.
* Who It Serves?: 
   * People who are passionate about cooking or want inspiration to learn a new recipe or two! It can also serve college students and parents.  
* What sets it apart?:
   * Combining the searching capability with recipes, but at the same time, filtering based upon preference like Vegetarian/Meat/AllergyFriendly
   * Having a Recipe of the Day come at the top every time we refresh?
