Welcome to our Web Application. This application is a recipe website that allows users to search for recipes. At the moment, users cannot search 
up recipes using custom criteria, however they can see Proof of Concept. The Recipe of the Day is just a random, fancy recipe.
However, despite the name, it is generated every page load. Our College Corner webpage shows a list of recipes that
take only 3-10 minutes to make. The "Parents Place" shows recipes that take 3-6 ingridients and also only 
3-10 minutes to make. The "Allergy Friendly" page shows only two recipes, one that is Gluten free and another 
that is Dairy free. There is also a feedback page that allows users to submit their thoughts about the website. 
This feedback is stored in a mySQL database and was created through phpMyAdmin. In the future, we intend to add 
dropdowns to the search bar that allow users to search for recipes based on what they want to proritize. 

NOTES:
The SQL for the entire Database is stored in the file caled Feedback_DB.sql. This file can be found in 
the "backend" directory of the project.
